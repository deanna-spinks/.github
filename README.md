# Deanna Spinks – Portfolio Organization
Welcome 👋

This GitHub organization is under development and was primarily created so I can utilise Linear integrations with GitHub.

I intend to showcase select portfolio projects highlighting my skills in **software engineering, data, AI/ML and systems programming** here.  

For additional repositories, experiments, and learning projects, see my [personal GitHub account](https://github.com/deannaspinks) or ask me about the more interesting projects I've been working that aren't publicly available.
